I am a Frontend Developer, that is passionate about developing web applications that solves real problems. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in modern frameworks and technologies like NextJs, ReactJs, TypeScript, Redux, React-Query (TanStack), Axios, React-Hook-Form, Supabase, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI, Bootstrap, and Git.

I have had the opportunity to teach and mentor aspiring frontend developers, helping them understand modern web technologies and adopt best practices. I enjoy simplifying complex concepts and guiding others to become better developers.

I am also looking forward to expanding my skills into backend development to broaden my expertise and build more robust, full-stack solutions. 

I am always open to learning other frameworks and technologies to deliver the best results. 

Let us connect and build something amazing together.
