 Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web developer in the making. I spend my days with my hands on front end engineering (HTML, CSS JQuery/Javascript), looking forward to work on back end programming (python PHP and so on), and also add cybersecurity as a career. I have passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. Feel free to give me a shoutout @Error-at-night. Feel free to reach out incase you want to get in touch also.
