Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer with a strong focus on front-end development, passionate about building visually appealing, responsive, and user centric web applications. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in modern frameworks and tools like NextJs, ReactJs, Redux, TypeScript, React-Query (TanStack), React-Hook-Form, Supabase, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI, Bootstrap, and Git.

In addition to building web applications, I have experience teaching and mentoring aspiring developers as a Front-end Instructor, helping them understand modern web technologies and adopt best practices. I enjoy simplifying complex concepts and guiding others to become better developers.

I am looking forward to expanding my skills into back-end development to broaden my expertise and build more robust, full-stack solutions. I am always open to learning new frameworks and technologies to deliver the best results. 

Let us connect and build something amazing together.
